                <li>With this project I delve deep to learn coding to able to build a website with no prior HTML or CSS knowledge what so ever</li>
                <br>
                <li>Building my first HTML page was a challenging but rewarding experience. I had no prior knowledge of HTML, so I had to start from scratch and research everything online. I spent a lot of time learning about the different tags and elements, and experimenting with different layouts and designs. I also learned how to use CSS to style my page and add some visual interest. In the end, I was able to create a simple study guide. While there's still much to learn and improve upon, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with no prior experience</li>

                <p>I recently debugged a website that had poor HTML semantics, making it difficult for accessibility readers to navigate. I spent several hours going through the code and identifying areas where I could improve the structure and formatting to make it more accessible. Additionally, I was able to optimize some of the HTML to be more understandable. By the end of the project, I had not only fixed the accessibility issues but also maintained the website's functionality and visual appeal. I'm proud to include this project in my portfolio as an example of my skills in web development and problem-solving.</p>

                <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Rice University coding bootcamp to become a full stack developer. The bootcamp has been an intense but rewarding experience, as I've been able to dive deep into programming languages and tools that I was previously unfamiliar with. From building basic HTML pages to creating dynamic web applications with JavaScript, I've been able to hone my skills and gain confidence in my ability to code.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One of the things I appreciate most about the bootcamp is the collaborative environment. I'm surrounded by like-minded individuals who are passionate about coding and eager to help each other succeed. Whether it's working through a particularly tricky bug or offering feedback on a project, I always feel supported and encouraged to push myself to new heights.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another aspect of the bootcamp that I find valuable is the focus on practical experience. Rather than just learning theory and syntax, we're given real-world projects to work on that mimic the challenges we'll face in the industry. This hands-on experience has allowed me to see the tangible impact of my coding skills and has prepared me for a career in web development.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Overall, the Rice University coding bootcamp has been a transformative experience for me. I've learned so much in a short amount of time and feel confident in my ability to build robust, dynamic web applications. I'm excited to continue honing my skills and seeing where this journey takes me in the world of web development.</p>
